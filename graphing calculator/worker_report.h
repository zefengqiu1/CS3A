Features:
        -Not Implemented: I have complete all the requirement.
        -Implemented: Token,Number,Operator, rparent,lparen,shunting_yard,evaluate,variable,system,
                        animate,circle,point,sidebar,RPN class design with their member functions and
         private member variable.

        -Partly implemented:I think I completed all the requirements.

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:For this project,I more deeply understand how inheritance work with class and subclass. know the basic rule
    or syntax and how it will use in the application.  keyword virtual is very useful when doing the Polymorphism,
    It will automatically call their own member functions in the class once overriding the function.
    algorithm is quite interesting in the Shunting_yard. convert the normal operator to the RPN style.
    for graphing part, I take some time to get familar with sfml tool because I didnt used it before. I had hard time in
    zoom in and zoom out part.once zoom in and zoom out, the domain would increase and decrease at the same time.also,need
    to transform the point by size so that we could see clearly in the graph. error check is another one need to pay more
    attention. i feel proud of myself from nothing to here.
